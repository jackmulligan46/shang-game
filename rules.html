  <h1>Shang Rules</h1>

  <p>Shang is a fast-paced shedding card game played with four players, based on tactics, timing, and bluffing. It’s loosely inspired by Big Two and similar climbing games, but features a unique format for hand combinations and strategic check passes. Shang is especially popular in tight-knit friend groups and college houses where competition and banter go hand in hand.</p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>The goal of Shang is to be the first player to get rid of all 13 of your cards in each round. Rounds continue until one player runs out of cards. The game continues over multiple rounds until a player collects a total of 26 cards across rounds (this ends the game).</p>

  <h2>Deck, Card, and Suit Rank</h2>
  <p>The game uses a standard 52-card deck, and cards are ranked from lowest to highest as follows:</p>
  <p><strong>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A</strong></p>
  <p>Suits are used to break ties and are ranked from lowest to highest as:</p>
  <p><strong>Clubs ♣ < Diamonds ♦ < Hearts ♥ < Spades ♠</strong></p>

  <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
  <p>Each player is dealt 13 cards. The player with the <strong>2♣</strong> must start the very first hand of the first round. This can be played as a single, a pair, or as part of a five-card combination (fiver). After the first round, whoever played the last hand (i.e., "took the table") starts the next.</p>

  <p>Play proceeds clockwise. Players can either:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Play</strong> a valid hand that beats the previous one (same hand type, higher rank)</li>
    <li><strong>Check</strong> (pass)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A hand is considered “taken” and the table resets after <strong>three consecutive checks</strong>. The player who played the last hand then starts the next round with any valid play.</p>

  <p>Players may check even if they can beat the current play, but once checked, they must wait for the table to reset before rejoining.</p>

  <h2>Valid Hands</h2>
  <p>There are four categories of legal plays:</p>

  <h3>1. Singles</h3>
  <p>Any one card. Higher singles beat lower ones; suit breaks ties if rank is equal.</p>

  <h3>2. Pairs</h3>
  <p>Two cards of the same rank. Suit of the higher card determines the tiebreak.</p>

  <h3>3. Trips</h3>
  <p>Three cards of the same rank.</p>

  <h3>4. Fivers</h3>
  <p>Five-card combinations ranked from weakest to strongest:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Straight</strong> – Five cards in sequence (e.g., 5-6-7-8-9), any suits</li>
    <li><strong>Flush</strong> – Five cards of the same suit</li>
    <li><strong>Full House</strong> – Three of a kind plus a pair (e.g., 9-9-9-6-6)</li>
    <li><strong>Quads</strong> – Four of a kind plus any fifth card</li>
    <li><strong>Straight Flush</strong> – Five sequential cards of the same suit</li>
    <li><strong>Royal Flush</strong> – 10-J-Q-K-A of the same suit</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Aces are high, and 2s are the lowest.</strong> You cannot wrap straights (e.g., A-2-3-4-5 is not allowed).</p>

  <h2>Tie-Breaking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If two hands have the same type and rank, the suit of the highest card determines the winner.</li>
    <li>Suits rank as: <strong>Clubs < Diamonds < Hearts < Spades</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Scoring and Game End</h2>
  <p>After a round ends, each player adds the number of cards left in their hand to their total card count.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The game ends when <strong>any player reaches 26 or more</strong> total cards.</li>
    <li>The player with the <strong>lowest card total</strong> at that time wins.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Special Rules</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The first play of the game must contain the <strong>2♣</strong></li>
    <li>After a table reset (three checks), the last player to play may begin again with any hand</li>
    <li>Players may check even if they can beat the hand, but cannot rejoin until the table clears</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Strategy Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use bluffing to conserve power hands</li>
    <li>Watch suits for tiebreaker advantages</li>
    <li>Strong five-card hands give control late in the round</li>
  </ul>
